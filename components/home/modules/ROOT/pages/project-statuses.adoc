= Project Status

This page defines the lifecycle statuses I use across my open source projects.
Each project clearly states its current status so you know what to expect in
terms of stability, responsiveness, and long-term support.

As a solo independent maintainer, I prioritize clarity over ceremony. These
statuses are signals, not guarantees. They communicate intent, not legal
commitments. If a project's status changes, I will update it here and in the
repository.

== Experimental

*Expect rapid change and rough edges.*

Experimental projects are early-stage explorations. I am validating ideas,
APIs, and architecture. Breaking changes are likely. Documentation may be
incomplete. The goal is learning and iteration, not stability.

Use Experimental projects to explore concepts, prototype ideas, or provide
feedback. Do not depend on them in production.

== Maturing

*Actively developed and moving toward stability.*

Maturing projects have proven useful and are under active development. APIs may
still change, but changes are more deliberate. Documentation is improving.
Backward compatibility is considered, but not guaranteed.

These projects may be suitable for early production use if you are comfortable
upgrading as the project evolves.

== Stable

*Production-ready and maintained.*

Stable projects have a well-defined scope and API. I aim to preserve backward
compatibility. Changes are incremental and justified. Documentation should be
complete enough for independent use.

Use Stable projects in production with confidence. Major changes will be rare
and clearly communicated.

== Static

*Feature complete and minimally maintained.*

Static projects are considered complete. I do not plan to add new features. The
code remains available and usable, but development has effectively stopped.

I may address critical bugs or security issues if they are simple and low-risk.
Releases will be infrequent.

== Retired

*No longer maintained.*

Retired projects are archived and unmaintained. They may depend on outdated
technologies, have been replaced, or no longer align with my focus.

You are free to fork and continue development. I do not plan to review issues,
accept pull requests, or publish new releases.

If you rely on a project for critical use cases, prefer those marked *Stable*.
If you enjoy shaping software early, look for *Experimental* and *Maturing*
projects.

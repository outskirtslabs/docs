== Report a Security Issue

I take security reports seriously and will give them prompt attention.
Security issues should be reported privately to `casey@outskirtslabs.com`, please use the string `OSS-SEC` somewhere in the subject line.
You may encrypt emails with https://casey.link/pgp.asc[my public PGP key].
_Please_ do not file public issues for security vulnerabilities.

== Security Advisories

Remediation of security vulnerabilities for xref:open-source-vital-signs.adoc#maturing[maturing] and xref:open-source-vital-signs.adoc#stable[stable] projects is prioritized.
I endeavor to coordinate remediation with third-party stakeholders and am committed to transparency in the disclosure process.

Security issues are announced via Release notes and Security Advisories on the affected project's repository, as well as at https://docs.outskirtslabs.com[docs.outskirtslabs.com] on a best-effort basis.
